        <h2>The Shire where it starts</h2>
        <p>Difficulty-Beginner</p>
        <p>The Shire is the best beginnerâ€™s trip. It starts out slower and easier for those who are learning the ropes. Near the end you will hit some white rapids to provide an exciting ending. Since this is a beginner run, it will only cost $1000. The boats will be included but food will need to be provided by the customer. This is a two-day trip of off and on camping and rafting. It will inspire the adventurer to go for more white-water rafting adventures in the future. </p>

        <h2>The next river is Gondor</h2>
        <p>Difficulty-Advance</p>
