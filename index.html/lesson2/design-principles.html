            <h2>PARC Alignment</h2>
            <h3>steam</h3>
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com">Steam</a>
            <br>
            <img src="steam.jpg" alt="1part" width="300" height="500">
            <p>The first rule I depicted here is alignment. The way this works on the website shows that all the games 
                are aligned on the center of the screen. There are also smaller search bars on the sides that will pull out,
                 but almost everything is in the center for convenience and speed. 
                 This especially works for users on their phones. Also, I have noticed on most of my web searching, that websites have a center alignment.

            <h2>PARC: Proximity</h2>
            <h3>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</h3>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">lds</a>
            <br>
            <img src="lds.jpg" alt="2part" width="300" height="500">
            <p>For proximity, I chose the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints homepage. 
                The reason why this website is an example of proximity is that all the new articles and videos on topics are all grouped on one are, next to each other.
                The reason this works for the church is that, if you keep all the information together, the user isnâ€™t hunting for new or related material. It makes it easier and takes less time. 
            </p>

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h3>Amazon</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>
            <br>
            <img src="amazon.jpg" alt="3part"  width="300" height="500">
            <p>For the hicks law, I chose Amazon to be the website. With most shopping web pages,
                 they always have the suggested options related to the items the person is already shopping for.
                 The way Amazon does this is by looking at what you have searched and finding things that are related to the items. 
                 The more choices the user has, the longer they are going to stay on the webpages, and the more likely the user is to eventually buy something.
